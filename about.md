I live in Accra, Ghana and I am very passionate about programming. I mainly program in PHP, Ruby and JavaScript. I am a Laravel enthusiast and have used it to build a number of projects. I also love playing video games - some of my favourite games include COD, Battlefield, FIFA, Red Dead Redemption, just to mention a few. Genres of music I enjoy include Jazz, Trap, EDM and some classic old school Hip-Hop.

With this blog, I hope to share with you my thoughts and knowledge I have gathered in my programming journey and basically everything about me.

### Work
[expressPay](https://expresspaygh.com){:target="_blank"} is Ghana's first payment platform that actually works. At expressPay, we serve as that single platform or medium through which you can send and receive money from a variety of options(Mobile Money, Card Payments) as well as pay for services such electricity, water, internet...you name it.

### Community
I recently teamed up with the [forloop Ghana](https://forloop.africa){:target="_blank"} through my colleague at work- [Ore Ogundipe](https://orecod.es){:target="_blank"}. At *forloop*, I help organise meetups and hackathons for up coming developers(first event in a couple of weeks -*super excited*). Due to my introvert nature, I haven't given any talks yet. I however have intentions of doing so very soon.

I love meeting new people or making new friends so feel free to _holla_ at me on:
